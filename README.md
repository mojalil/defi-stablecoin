# Defi Stable Coin

## Design Considerations

1. (Relative Stability) Anchored or pegged --> $1.00 USD
   1. Chainlink PriceFeed
   2. Set function to exchange eth & btc --> $$$
2. Stability Mechanism (Minting): Algorithmic (Decentralised)
   1. People can only mint the stable coin with enough collateral (coded)
3. Colleteral: Exogenous  (Crypto)
   1. wETH
   2. wBTC
